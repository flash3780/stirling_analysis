Stirling Engine Thermodynamic Analysis

This set of Stirling engine scripts was developed by Dr. Israel Urieli
of Ohio University.

The original scripts are available at
http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/stirling/me422.html

Minor changes have been made to improve plotting and performance, but
mostly as a learning exercise.
